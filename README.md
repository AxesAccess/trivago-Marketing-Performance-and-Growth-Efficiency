# Marketing Performance & Growth Efficiency at trivago

This repository contains a report on marketing performance, efficiency,
and growth drivers at **trivago**, a leading global hotel metasearch
platform. The analysis focuses on how marketing investment translates
into sustainable growth, with particular attention to Return on
Advertising Spend (ROAS), demand quality, and conversion efficiency
during trivago’s ongoing strategic turnaround.

The project is designed as a strategy-oriented marketing intelligence
case reflecting the aggregated and partially qualitative nature of
publicly available data.

## Objectives

The analysis aims to:

-   Assess how effectively trivago converts marketing investment into
    referral revenue.

-   Evaluate regional differences in marketing efficiency and growth
    elasticity.

-   Understand the role of brand investment, traffic composition, and
    user loyalty.

-   Identify structural enablers and risks affecting long-term marketing
    performance.

-   Derive strategic implications for marketing capital allocation and
    measurement.

## Scope of Analysis

The report covers the period 2023–2025 and is based on:

-   Advertising spend and referral revenue by geographic segment.

-   ROAS and ROAS contribution trends.

-   Traffic composition (branded vs. performance channels).

-   User loyalty indicators (logged-in user contribution).

-   Conversion efficiency improvements and product initiatives.

-   Marketplace structure and advertiser concentration.

## Methodological Notes

The analysis relies on aggregated segment-level data, not campaign- or
user-level metrics.

Both quantitative metrics and qualitative management commentary are
used.

Findings are directional and strategic, not intended for tactical
optimization.

Given these constraints, the report emphasizes interpretation, economic
logic, and decision relevance over granular attribution modeling.
